this (very stupid) project visualizes sorting algorithms using musical notation on a stave. Each note represents a value in an array, and as the algorithm sorts them, you can see their positions update dynamically.

*How to Run* 

Install Dependencies:

make you have **lua** and **LÃ–VE (Love2D)** installed on your system.  
download **LÃ–VE** from [love2d.org](https://love2d.org).  

CLONE THE REPO: 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aashnakunk/Love2D.git
   cd Love2D
   ```

**Running a Specific Project** :  
go to the folder of the project you want to run. for example, to run **bubble sort visualization**:  
     ```sh
     cd sorting-algorithms/bubble
     love .
     ```
similarly, for other projects, go to their respective directories and just run:  
     ```sh
     love .
     ```

Files to ensure the presence of : 
 `main.lua` file  and some  projects may also have `note.wav` (for sound).
